Next + Redux + antd
===
- just my tempate for upcoming projects 
- react-hooks, it seems kinda fun but it is hard to debug without redux-devtools
- context + hooks: so from now on, we can say good bye to redux

BTW, dev frontend is so annoying LOL, it seems like i have to create boilerplates every year
